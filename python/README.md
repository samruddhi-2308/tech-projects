# Python Projects

This folder showcases a variety of Python-based projects I’ve built to develop hands-on skills in data analysis, automation, and software development.
Each project is designed to solve a specific problem or explore a concept, and all code is written from scratch for educational and demonstrative purposes.

## Projects Included

- **Spotify Analysis** — Deep data-driven exploration of personal listening patterns using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
- **Terminal Confession Booth** — A lightweight terminal app built with Python that lets users anonymously write and securely store encrypted confessions using ROT13 encryption and local file storage.

Each subfolder contains:
- A project-specific `README.md` explaining the context and goals
- A working `.ipynb` or `.py` script demonstrating the implementation
