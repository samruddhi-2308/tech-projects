# Spotify Listening Pattern Analysis

This project analyzes my Spotify listening history to uncover behavioral insights using Python and essential data science libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.

## 📌 What It Covers

- Data cleaning and filtering of raw JSON logs
- Conversion of timestamps and duration features
- Aggregation of listening time by:
  - Artist
  - Hour of day
  - Day of week
- Visualizations for each trend using bar charts

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python latest
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## 📈 Outcome

This was my first data science project using personal data. I wrote every step from scratch and deeply understood:
- How to clean and transform real-world JSON data
- How to group and visualize key trends
- The workflow of building a complete exploratory analysis
